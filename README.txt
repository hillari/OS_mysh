mysh is a simple shell implementation wirtten in C.  This is a homework assignment for Operating Systems, CSCE A320, at the University of Alaska Anchorage. 

Usage:

Compile and run the program using makefile (simply type make), then use;

<command> <arg1> <arg2> .... <argN> 

To exit, use "CTRL+D" (twice, for some reason. Still working on this bug) or type "exit"
